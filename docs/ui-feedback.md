# UI Feedback

## Onboard Screen

- [ ] Hero image should be larger, probably make it the background to section the page and make it look scrollable
- [ ] Key features should come first, e.g. interactive lessons before discussions
- [ ] Add an intro before the feature section
- [ ] Include the name eddi earlier and make it clear.

## Dashboard

- [ ] Consider hierarchy for section i.e timetable should be much clearer and larger than school news, assessments > school news

## Timetable

- [ ] Be able to see future days on timetable
- [ ] Split when events intersect e.g. split classes and school fair to see they are both on at the same time

## Subject Home

- [ ] Again consider hierarchy, dont need contacts to be as large as classes or assessments, remove contacts and move email next to teacher's name at the top

## Discussion

- [ ] If we split announcements with other make it so only teacher can write announcements and rename other to something else
- [ ] Maybe post announcement on class home page

## Lessons

- [ ] Generate image as background for lesson, make sure its of the same styling
- [ ] Stack lessons vertically rather than scroll horizontally as its easier to see

## Lesson Building

- [ ] Title too big
- [ ] Image block shouldn't say edit image when in edit mode
- [ ] Move switch mode button out of the lesson section
- [ ] When in preview mode, hide blocks section and expend lesson section
- [ ] Add tool tip with block name when hovering over it
- [ ] Space that is above the contents, lesson and blocks section should be the same below them

## Lesson Generation

- [ ] Need equal margin at the top and bottom of the page
- [x] Confusing, thought description was for the prompt
- [ ] Maybe add a prompt section to make specific requests
- [x] Lesson generation is a bit scuffed, make a fake youtube link and didn't create a lesson for the topic specific in the the title and description when no pdf was uploaded
