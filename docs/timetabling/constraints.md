# Handling Timetable Constraints:

## Background:

Every constraint has a weight. A weight of 100% mean that this constraint must be respected. A lower value mean it should be respected, it's not necessary. It's pretty difficult to explain the exact function, but a simple illustration is the following: 50% weight mean that in average FET retries two times to place an activity without a conflict. If FET isn't able to place the activity without a conflict after average 2 times it keeps the conflict and tries to place the next activity.
