- **Note**: Can also be used for floor changes by setting floors as "buildings"

## Weight Guidelines

- **100%**: Constraint MUST be satisfied
- **95-99%**: Highly preferred, rare violations acceptable
- **90-95%**: Strongly preferred
- **50-90%**: Moderately preferred
- **Below 50%**: Weakly preferred

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Add basic constraints first, then optimize
2. **Save Frequently**: Save with new filenames after adding constraints
3. **Test Solvability**: Check if timetable remains solvable after each addition
4. **Use High Weights Initially**: Start with high values and decrease if necessary
5. **Consider Substitution**: Be careful with too many restrictive teacher constraints
6. **Check Statistics**: Review generated statistics to verify constraint effects
