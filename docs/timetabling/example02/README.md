This is a block planning example from Darren McDonald in the fet source code that should theoretically:

1. Assign teachers to classes
2. Assign teachers to periods they can work

It seems to not consider rooms and buildings, which we might be able to implement and see what the results are. Let's edit the fet file and add rooms and buildings, then see what the output is.
