# Demo Guide

## Functionality

How do we effectively demonstrate eddi's capabilities within minutes? A comprehensive seed script setup and automated demo might help with this.

## Desires

How does eddi meet the needs of the school? What might be missing from its capabilities in order to get going? How would it complement their existing tools for now, and potentially replace them in the future?

## Open Source, Data Ownership, Export Capabilities

1. Convey the power of open sourcing the software in that students, teachers, and school admin teams can steer eddi's development direction

2. Stress that there are far too many solutions out there nowadays that lock you in, forcing you to accept cost bumps or poor service because there are no other options.

3. Highlight eddi's export-first model. We're so confident that we've built something great that if you don't like it you can take all your data out with the click of one button.

## Feature Requests / Feature Prioritisation

eddi has a publicly visible roadmap available in `docs/roadmap.md` where you can see what we are prioritising at the moment. If you think something should be at a higher priority than it is, we're more than happy to accept feedback. Additionally, if something is missing from the roadmap, you are welcome to open a GitHub issue to start a discussion on that feature and gauge the thoughts of the eddi community.
