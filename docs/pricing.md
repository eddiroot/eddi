# Pricing

## Requirements

1. There is only one pricing tier. There will only ever be one pricing tier. Every customer of eddi's gets the same advanced functionality, forever.
2. The pricing is fixed rate so that the school can accurately estimate costs. There is no discount for paying in advance (e.g. annually).
3. AI usage costs should be bundled in with the pricing, accounting for the average student's usage with some level of buffer.

## Pricing Structure

### v0 Draft (2025-06-24)

1. We encourage and appreciate school's choosing us as their hosting provider as it directly supports the development of eddi and gets you a contact line directly with the engineers behind the product.

2. If you choose us as your hosting provider, your first month is free, and subsequent months will be billed at the price advised below.

3. Pricing will initially be set at $20 per user per month inclusive of AI usage. A user may be a student, teacher, or someone else in the school's staff. You may utilise shared accounts if you wish, though we advise having one account per person to fully utilise eddi's AI capabilities.
