# eddi Co-Founder Agreement

This Co-Founder Agreement ("Agreement") is made effective as of the **17th of June 2025** by and between the undersigned co-founders (each a "Co-Founder" and collectively the "Co-Founders") of **eddi** (the "Company"), a startup committed to enhancing the education system.

## 1. Purpose and Intent

The Co-Founders enter into this Agreement to establish a clear understanding of their respective rights, responsibilities, and the foundational principles governing the operation and future direction of the Company.

## 2. Open-Source Commitment

All code, intellectual property, and derivative works relevant to the eddi application shall be **open-source forever**. This commitment is fundamental to the Company's mission and operations. For any portion of the code or intellectual property to become closed-source, the unanimous written consent of **all founding** Co-Founders is required.

## 3. Equity Distribution and Contribution

Equity in the Company shall be split **evenly** among all Co-Founders, provided each Co-Founder has contributed a "fair amount" to the development of the Company's prototype and initial operations. A "fair amount" is defined as:

- Attendance at a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of all scheduled in-person development days, unless significant personal reasons (e.g., serious illness, bereavement) prevented such attendance.

- Active contribution of ideas, constructive feedback, and strategic input regarding the product and business direction.

- Demonstrable contribution to the successful development or implementation of at least one significant feature within the eddi product.

The assessment of "fair amount" shall be made by mutual agreement of the Co-Founders.

## 4. Free Provision of Software to "In-Need" Schools

The eddi software shall be provided, supported, and hosted, free of charge, for high schools identified as "in-need". A high school shall be considered "in-need" if it demonstrably falls into one or more of the following categories:

- Has an Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) value significantly below the national average, indicating socio-educational disadvantage.

- Has a high proportion of students from low socio-economic backgrounds, as evidenced by eligibility for specific government equity funding.

- Is located in a designated remote or regional area with limited access to educational resources and technology infrastructure.

## 5. Commitment to Educational Betterment

The Co-Founders commit to making a **best effort** to develop, enhance, and deploy software solutions that genuinely contribute to and better the education system, aligning with eddi's core mission.

## 6. Future Company Status

The Company shall **never** pursue or undertake a public listing (e.g., Initial Public Offering on a stock exchange) unless and until such a decision is unanimously agreed upon in writing by **all founding** Co-Founders.

## 7. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia, and the Commonwealth of Australia. The Co-Founders agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria for any disputes arising under this Agreement.

## 8. Entire Agreement
