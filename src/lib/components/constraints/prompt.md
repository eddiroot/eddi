# Constraint Form Creation Flow:
For the following constraints, i want you to create forms by following the following steps:
1. Identify the fields required for each constraint based on its FETName and parameters. (consider unique_constraints.txt)
2. Determine the appropriate input types for each field (e.g., text, number, date, select, checkbox).
3. Utilize the Autocomplete component for fields that require selection from a predefined list of options.
4. Create a Svelte component for each constraint form, ensuring it includes:
    - Properly labeled input fields.
    - Validation rules for each input field.
    - A submit button that triggers a function to handle form submission.
5. Ensure the forms are user-friendly and accessible, with clear instructions and error messages where necessary. Consider the
    existing design system and UI components for consistency.
6. Add a case statement in constraint-form-mapping.ts
