timetable restrictions

Start time: 8:30
End time: 3:20

5 classes per day => 25 classes per week => 1 student with 5 subjects
must have 5 classes, 1 for each subject per week.......this will work 
for the seeding data. 


NOTE:
only Emma Thompson has classes for the moment whilst we wait on timetable generation to be done.


For EACH subject, there is one subject offering for S1 2025. 
- For EACH subject offering, there are 2 classes
- There are 5 userSubjectOfferings for each student (EACH student is enrolled in 5 subjects)
- There are 2 userSubjectOfferings for each teacher (EACH teacher can teach 2 subjects)
- The userSubjectOfferings that are chosen are deterministic (same each time)
- each user will have the following timetable layout:

P1: 0830-0940
P2: 0945-1025
Recess: 1030-1055
P3: 1100-1210
P4: 1215-1255
Lunch: 1300-1355
P5: 1400-1515



- therefore 5 classes per day => 25 classes per week => 1 student with 5 subjects must have 1 class for 
each subject per day.......this will work for the seeding data
- For each student, they will be allocated to a random class for each subject. (will be given a userSubjectClass)
