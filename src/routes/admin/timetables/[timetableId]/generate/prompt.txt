PROBLEM:

I've got a current issue with the current implementation of the forms for constraints. 
Currently, the forms ask for certain activity or teacher or subject etc 
depending on what the constraint needs. This is currently always an open text field 
however i want the fields to be constrained to what the textfield specifically needs. 
Lastly the fet timetable generation is currently storing the names of the parameters (
  subject names like Mathematics or teacher names Mr Smith ) when it needs to be storing 
the ids of the subject and/or teachers etc from the db

SOLUTION:

For each of the following attributes (pgtable name):
- timetableDay (tt_day)
- timetablePeriod (tt_period)
- subjects (sub)
- users (user with userType: teachers, students)
- timetableGroup (tt_group)
- buildings (sch_bldng)
- schoolSpace (sch_space)
- timetableActivity (tt_activity)

can you please create some sort of element that can be used in conjunction with
the constraint forms that constrains the inputted values to the desired object in the db.
this element should enable prefill options to appear based on the current search from the user
and should map the name that the user selects to the ID of that specific db object.
